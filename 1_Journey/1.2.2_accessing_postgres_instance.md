To access your PostgreSQL instance, forward port 5432 from the `single-instance-cluster-rw` service to your local machine using the following command:

```sh
kubectl port-forward svc/single-instance-cluster-rw 5432:5432 -n postgresql-operator-system
```

After running this command, connect to the PostgreSQL database using a PostgreSQL client like `psql`:

```sh
psql -h localhost -U postgres
```

To install `psql` (the PostgreSQL client) in your Codespace, you can use the following commands:

1. Update the package list:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

2. Install the PostgreSQL client:

```bash
sudo apt-get install postgresql-client -y
```

After the installation is complete, you should be able to use the `psql` command to connect to your PostgreSQL database:

```bash
psql -h localhost -U postgres
```

Make sure to replace `postgres` with the appropriate username if it's different.
