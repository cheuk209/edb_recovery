# 1.1 Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to set up EnterpriseDB (EDB) Postgres in a Minikube environment on GitHub Codespaces. This will help us gain familiarity with EDB Postgres and its functionalities. The key goals include:

1. **Setup and Configuration**: 
   - Install and configure EDB Postgres within a Minikube cluster on GitHub Codespaces.
   - Ensure the environment is properly set up for development and testing purposes.

2. **Familiarization with EDB Postgres**:
   - Explore the features and capabilities of EDB Postgres.
   - Understand the differences and advantages of using EDB Postgres over other PostgreSQL distributions.

3. **Backup and Recovery**:
   - Perform backup operations on the EDB Postgres database and its schema.
   - Test and validate the recovery process to ensure data integrity and availability.

By achieving these objectives, we aim to build a robust understanding of EDB Postgres and its operational procedures, which will be crucial for future projects and deployments.
