The pod `edb-pg4k-edb-postgres-for-kubernetes-d6ff8858d-ntwth` is not the PostgreSQL instance itself. It is the pod running the EDB Postgres for Kubernetes Operator (PG4K), which manages PostgreSQL clusters within your Kubernetes environment.

To create a single PostgreSQL instance for your Proof of Concept (PoC), you need to apply a configuration that specifies a single instance. Here is a minimal YAML configuration to create a single PostgreSQL instance:

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: postgresql.k8s.enterprisedb.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: single-instance-cluster
  namespace: postgresql-operator-system
spec:
  instances: 1
  storage:
    size: 1Gi
EOF
```

This configuration creates a PostgreSQL cluster with a single instance and 1Gi of storage.

Kind is **cluster**. Interesting. apiVersion also provided by EnterpriseDB themselves. 

Wow, so I believe this is a higher level abstraction, so I don't need to configure service and deployment. It has automatically been created. Is this the EDB's benefits?

Yes, you are correct. The `Cluster` kind provided by EnterpriseDB is a higher-level abstraction that manages the creation of services, deployments, and other necessary resources for running a PostgreSQL cluster. This abstraction simplifies the process of deploying and managing PostgreSQL instances on Kubernetes.

When you applied the configuration to create the `Cluster`, the EDB Postgres for Kubernetes Operator (PG4K) automatically created the necessary services and deployments for you. This is one of the benefits of using the EDB operator, as it handles the complexity of managing PostgreSQL clusters on Kubernetes.

From the output of `kubectl get svc`, you can see that the following services have been created:

- `single-instance-cluster-r`: This service likely handles read-only traffic.
- `single-instance-cluster-ro`: This service likely handles read-only traffic.
- `single-instance-cluster-rw`: This service likely handles read-write traffic.

To access your PostgreSQL instance, you can forward port 5432 from the `single-instance-cluster-rw` service to your local machine. Here is the command to do that:

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/single-instance-cluster-rw 5432:5432 -n postgresql-operator-system
```

After running this command, you can connect to the PostgreSQL database using a PostgreSQL client like `psql`:

```bash
psql -h localhost -U postgres
```

Make sure to replace `postgres` with the appropriate username if it's different. This will allow you to access your PostgreSQL database locally.


After applying this configuration, verify the pods and services:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n postgresql-operator-system
kubectl get svc -n postgresql-operator-system
```

Look for a service that exposes port 5432. Once you identify the correct service, you can forward port 5432 to your local machine using the `kubectl port-forward` command. For example, if the service name is `single-instance-cluster`, the command would be:

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/single-instance-cluster 5432:5432 -n postgresql-operator-system
```

Replace `single-instance-cluster` with the actual service name that exposes port 5432. This will allow you to access the PostgreSQL database locally.
